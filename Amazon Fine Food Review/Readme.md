   Implement NLK, LDA, NMF to cluster Amazon customer review text into 5 topics, use pyLDAvis for dynamic topic visualization, use cosine similarity to verify          correlations between review summary and text.
   Lemmatize words, create sentiment polarity score, convert words to numerical features using TF-IDFS, Doc2Vect for feature engineering. Reduce 86 features by         RFECV, define low information filter.
   Tune linear models (restrict to use LR, Ridge, Lasso) using GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, Optuna, reach test RMSE to 0.91.
